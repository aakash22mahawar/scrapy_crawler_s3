<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a franchise owner, one of the most critical aspects of your business success is securing a favorable lease agreement for your franchise location. Whether you're opening a new franchise or renewing an existing lease, navigating the complexities of lease negotiations can significantly impact your bottom line. To ensure you secure advantageous terms and save money, follow this checklist to help you come out ahead during your next negotiation.</span>
<h2><b> Reviewing the Lease Agreement</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before diving into negotiations, it's essential to thoroughly review the lease agreement with the assistance of a real estate lawyer who understands the intricacies of franchise leases. Key areas to focus on include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confirming all exhibits and documents are attached to the lease.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Validating the legal entity of the other party.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the type of lease being offered (e.g., triple net, gross, modified gross).</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researching fair market value to determine reasonable rent expectations.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paying special attention to maintenance, repair, and common area expenses clauses.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b> Understanding the Clauses</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each clause in your lease can significantly impact your financial obligations and operational flexibility. It's crucial to understand and negotiate these clauses effectively:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rent adjustment clause: Evaluate if your rent is tied to sales or third-party indexes and avoid unpredictable increases like consumer price index (CPI) adjustments.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renewal clause: Negotiate for favorable renewal options to maintain control over your franchised premises.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assignment/Sublease clause: Discuss terms for subleasing or assigning the space to protect your interests in case of business changes.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Franchise Improvement clause: Request allowances or rent abatements to offset costs for improving the franchised premises.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early Termination clause: Understand conditions and penalties associated with terminating the lease early.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">CAM clause: Common area maintenance clauses can be vague, but this is one area you definitely want clarity on to ensure you don’t get stuck paying for more than anticipated. </span><a href="https://leasecake.com/blog/the-importance-and-financial-impact-of-cam-clauses-in-your-commercial-lease/#:~:text=In%20a%20fixed%20CAM%20structure,and%20expense%20of%20an%20audit." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More details here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b> Negotiating Points</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When negotiating lease terms, consider the following strategies to optimize your agreement:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Term Length: Discuss trade-offs between rent reduction and lease duration, backed by market research.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concessions: Request landlord-provided franchise improvements or rent abatements to enhance your space.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">CAM Charges: Negotiate favorable terms on common area maintenance expenses to control additional costs.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exclusive Use Clauses: Seek exclusivity rights to prevent direct competition within the property.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assignment and Subletting: Clarify terms for assigning or subletting the space to maintain flexibility.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Admin Fees: Negotiate the removal of administrative fees if rent is on the higher end.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b> Finalizing the Deal</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once negotiations are complete, take these steps to finalize the lease agreement:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal Review: Seek counsel from a leasing specialist to review and address any legal concerns.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documenting Agreements: Ensure all negotiated changes are documented in writing and added to the lease.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review Final Lease: Double-check the final lease draft to confirm negotiated terms accurately.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Approval and Execution: Coordinate with the landlord to sign the lease agreement and retain copies for your records.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b> Staying on Top of the Details</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure ongoing compliance and preparedness for future negotiations:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lease Audits: Schedule periodic reviews to ensure compliance with lease terms.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reminders and Dates: Utilize </span><a href="https://leasecake.com/solutions/lease-management-software/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lease management software</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to track critical dates and receive automated reminders.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prepare for Renegotiation: Start lease renegotiations well in advance to maintain negotiating leverage.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b> Building Strong Relationships with Landlords</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishing and maintaining a positive relationship with your landlord is crucial for the success of your franchise.  Good communication fosters mutual understanding and trust between you and your landlord. Be proactive in addressing any concerns or issues related to the lease agreement promptly. Regularly update your landlord on the status of your franchise and any significant developments that may affect the property.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A good relationship with your landlord can lead to greater flexibility and cooperation when it comes to lease negotiations or addressing unexpected challenges. By demonstrating your commitment to being a responsible tenant and maintaining the property, you may find your landlord more willing to accommodate reasonable requests or offer concessions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Inevitably, issues may arise during the term of your lease, such as maintenance issues or disputes over lease terms. Having a positive relationship with your landlord can facilitate the prompt resolution of these issues, minimizing disruptions to your franchise operations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a strong relationship with your landlord can yield long-term benefits for your franchise. A satisfied landlord may be more inclined to renew your lease on favorable terms or provide support for expansions or renovations. Additionally, a positive recommendation from your landlord can enhance your reputation and credibility when seeking new franchise opportunities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By prioritizing good communication and fostering a positive relationship with your landlord, franchise owners can create a conducive environment for success and longevity in their leased premises.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following this lease negotiation checklist empowers franchise owners to confidently navigate the complexities of franchise leases, secure favorable terms, and ultimately save money while ensuring the success of their businesses.</span>
