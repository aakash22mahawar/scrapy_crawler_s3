<span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">Leascake gave Dixon and Team Oney Brands a tool designed to provide access to everything he needed wherever he was. “Before, I could access the information from those sources, but it wasn’t always easy. If someone asked me a question about a lease and I wasn’t in the office, I could go through 15 steps on my phone and get the information they needed. But it was time-consuming. Now I use Leasecake, and it helps tremendously because all the information is at my fingertips on my phone, on my iPad, and on my desktop.”</span>

<span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">“With so many stores, there are </span><span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">multiple things I have to do on a daily basis," said Dixon.

Here are some of the results after having adopted <a href="https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/featured-supplier/leasecake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leasecake</a>:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>24/7 Access:</strong> <span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">Instant access to all the lease and location data needed for any of his locations at a moment's notice.</span></li>
 	<li><strong>Single Source of Truth:</strong> <span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">All lease and location data is organized and accessible for the whole team.</span></li>
 	<li><strong>ASC 842 Compliance:</strong> <span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">Accounting and reporting is simple and easy, without having to struggle in excel spreadsheets to prepare for upcoming audits.</span></li>
