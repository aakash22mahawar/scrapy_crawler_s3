Real Estate Services for Franchises
Lease management can be difficult and time-consuming, and it’s something many real estate franchises could benefit from streamlining. If you’re in the real estate industry and are struggling to manage your growing portfolio, working with a real estate services provider could save you time and money while helping you grow your business.
What Are Real Estate Services?
Real estate services providers offer a full spectrum of real estate solutions, including managing construction projects, assisting with compliance and monitoring, and providing lease management software and solutions to support real estate franchise owners in their day-to-day operations.
Many franchisees assume the difficult part of operating in the real estate industry is signing leases. However, the work doesn’t end there. Collecting lease payments, handling property management and maintaining compliance are all important tasks — and easy to lose track of when you have a large property portfolio. If you’re a property developer, working with a company that manages construction projects helps you keep track of contractors and ensure your builds are completed on time and within budget.
Real estate services providers handle these tasks, helping you focus on finding new properties and growing your base of tenants. Both B2B and B2C real estate franchisees can benefit from outsourcing elements of their real estate services.
Benefits of Hiring a Real Estate Service Supplier for Your Franchise Business
Hiring a real estate service provider to handle lease management and issues such as common area maintenance charges, dispute resolution and monitoring, and chasing monthly payments can save you time and allow you to focus on the core of your business. Let someone else do the administration while you look for opportunities to grow your portfolio or expand your business into new areas.
Outsourcing these services has another key benefit. When lease payments are managed by a third party, it can reduce conflict and make dealing with tenants a much smoother process.
Another often-overlooked, benefit of using lease management software is data collection. By systematically logging information about your property portfolio, you’ll build up a database of metrics you can use to make better decisions about future property purchases, pricing, and budgeting. From setting repair budgets to understanding market conditions, there’s a lot you can learn from tracking trends with your current portfolio.
