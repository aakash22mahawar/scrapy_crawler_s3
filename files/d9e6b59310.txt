We hosted our first of many Supplier Discovery Days earlier this month, and it was a great webinar event. Our panel of marketing supplier executives shared a TON of marketing tips &amp; tools for the year ahead - here were some of our key takeaways:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time is now to <strong>move beyond basic measurement KPIs</strong> (impressions, conversions) and evaluate customer lifetime value, profitability and other revenue-based KPIs to assess your marketing.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapping into <strong>athletes as content creators</strong> connects local franchise locations to the spirit and culture surrounding fans’ favorite school/team, delivering impact through positive associations.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of <strong>data mining</strong> and using this to target &amp; convert your ideal client and ideal potential franchisee.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence is shattering writers block and empowering franchisees to <strong>generate captions and contribute local content</strong> on social channels.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the recent iOS 14 privacy changes and the end of cookies, <strong>having your own database of customer information</strong> for which to engage and target is going to be critical. </span></li>
