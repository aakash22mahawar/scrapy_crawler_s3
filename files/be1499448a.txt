<strong>Jason</strong>
I love to help people architect solutions. I love to be involved in building software products and I love to watch people think through and create the tactics that support the execution of the strategies that drive success for their clients.

<strong>Chris</strong>
What we are trying to do is simplify the supply purchasing process and what we want to do is give franchisees a powerful set of procurement capabilities as an extension to any kind of modern e-commerce platform.

<strong>Jason</strong>
The frontline worker is more efficient, they are not logging into 4, 5, 6, 7 different websites, they are not searching in each of those different websites looking for that approved product or service they need to purchase to run their location or to sell to their member. It’s one login, it’s one search, it’s one product catalog and we are doing the work behind the scenes to bring all that into that one experience.
