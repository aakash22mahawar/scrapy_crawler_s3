<a href="https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/featured-supplier/dynaxe-workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynaxe Workforce</a> utilizes their business immigration expertise to support companies nationwide battling labor shortages and high turnover.

In this Franchise Supplier Wire Series episode of Modrn Business Podcast, Dean Hatzitheodosiou, the FSN Chief Sales Officer, chats with Matt O'Brien, Managing Director from Dynaxe Workforce. Dynaxe Workforce fills hundreds of entry-level roles using their U.S. immigration expertise, matching motivated foreign nationals with employers for US Permanent Residency. This scalable process reduces recruitment costs and eliminates rapid turnover, as candidates work a full year to earn their visas.

Dean and Matt discuss the challenges of QSR (Quick Service Restaurants) in solving labor shortages. Matt shares his experience with various sales roles across several industries and explains his current role at Dynaxe Workforce.
