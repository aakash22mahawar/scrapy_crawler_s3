<h1>Longtime Franchise Consultant John Francis Presented Office Pride System’s Highest Honor</h1>
October 27, 2023 // <a href="https://www.franchising.com/">Franchising.com</a> // PALM HARBOR, Fla. - John Francis, who served on the Office Pride Commercial Cleaning Services’ Board of Advisors from 2012-2022, received the franchise system’s Integrity Award, the company’s highest honor.

<strong>Francis, who is from Minnesota, was recognized at Office Pride’s annual owners’ retreat, which was held Sept. 27-30 in Louisville, Kentucky.</strong>

The Integrity Award is awarded annually to an individual or couple who exemplifies Office Pride’s core values and reflects all that the brand stands for - including honesty, integrity, a servant’s attitude and honoring God. Francis, a franchise consultant known as “Johnny Franchise,” is a frequent speaker at franchise conferences.

Francis has more than 25 years’ experience in franchising, starting with his family’s hair salon system, The Barbers, which eventually merged into Regis Corp. in 1999. He has served as a franchisor, franchisee, investor and board member for more than a dozen franchise organizations.
