<a href="https://blog.johnnyfranchise.com/3-tips-for-growing-your-franchise" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>via Johnny Franchise</em></a>

Franchising is currently experiencing a significant increase in interest, growth and profitability. Many of my franchisor clients have shared their positive trends, increased sales, and strong performance at the unit level. Generally, if your businesses survived the Covid factor and you are still operating, almost everyone I'm working with is seeing favorable outcomes.

With these positive trends and franchise forecasting in mind, I thought sharing three new tips for growing your franchise business would be helpful.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Number One: Take a Closer Look at Your Competitors</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Number Two: Articulate the Stories About Your Brand</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Number Three: Assess Your Current Staff and Provide Them More Clarity</strong></li>
