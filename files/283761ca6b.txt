For many emerging franchisors, franchising represents an entirely new landscape. Your prior business experience does little to illuminate a path in franchising. You can’t rely on your instincts and street smarts to guide you, because franchising involves a complicated web of relationships that all need to be in tune at the same time. Even if you have a superior product or service that distinguishes your brand from the competition, and makes money, you still need to have great relationships with franchisees, vendors, the community, state regulators and customers to truly succeed.

The Springboard 2023 Event gives you a fighting chance, by getting to you early, with industry best practices. You will receive valuable, actionable advice from experienced franchise founders who have been in your shoes, taken their lumps and went on to create successful franchise systems.

The <a href="http://franchisespringboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Springboard-2023-Program__Preliminary_Digital_Pages_82923.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official agenda</a> was just shared. Here's a few of the sessions we're looking forward to:

<h4><em><strong>Cliff Hudson - Former CEO &amp; Chairman, SONIC Drive-In</strong></em></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cliff Hudson, former CEO &amp; Chairman of the Board of SONIC Drive-In, will take Springboarders through his 35-year career in the franchise industry.

<h4><em><strong>Speaker: Tony Conza -  Founder, Blimpie</strong></em></h4>
<h4><em>Host: Sherri Fishman - Co-CEO, Fishman PR &amp; President, Franchise Elevator PR</em></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tony Conza, founder of Blimpie, will share his incredible 59-year journey of growing his sandwich empire. Conza will detail the humble founding story of 3 New Jersey high school friends that channeled their love for freshly-sliced sandwiches to escape their dead-end jobs by opening their 1st Blimpie. Ever wonder who first introduced the “low-calorie" menu item, opened the 1st modern non-traditional franchise location, established an official franchisee advisory council or put “salad” on a sandwich? In this session, Conza will discuss how Blimpie’s innovative approach helped originate so many strategies we see in the modern Food &amp; Beverage industry today; catapulting Blimpie to a peak of 2,000+ locations across North America.</span>
