<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Unlike a traditional Learning Management System (LMS) that exists as a standalone platform, Woven's integrated Learning &amp; Development tools are revolutionizing how franchises train, engage, and retain their employees. This approach is not only enhancing the learning experience but also significantly boosting usage rates and ROI for franchisors.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Woven Advantage</strong></h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The typical LMS works in isolation, often requiring separate logins and manual management by location managers. This traditional model results in low engagement after the initial onboarding, with frontline employees rarely using the system. However, in ways that ensure franchisees and their employees will see them every day, Woven’s integration means that training and development become a natural part of employees' daily routines, dramatically increasing usage and engagement.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Woven's platform does more than just host content; it makes learning a vital part of the franchise's operational ecosystem. When new courses need to be taken or content updated, the integration ensures that frontline employees are immediately aware and engaged. This constant visibility means that learning is not a separate, forgettable task but a continuous, engaging process. The result is a significant increase in newly learned information and practices within the franchise, directly impacting the franchisor's ROI.</p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Testimony to Innovation and ROI</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By moving away from the disconnected nature of traditional LMS solutions, franchises report not just improvements in employee performance and satisfaction but also in operational efficiency and cost savings. This improvement is a testament to Woven's model, resulting in higher ROI for franchisors through increased engagement and training courses.</p>
