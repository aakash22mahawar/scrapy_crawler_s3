<strong><em>Marketing Supply Chain Firms Names Dan Geyer to Lead Sales</em></strong>

Feb 6, 2024 (Pittsburgh, PA) – <a href="https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/featured-supplier/clayton-kendall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clayton Kendall</a>, a leader in centralizing the marketing supply chains for franchise communities and multi-location businesses, announced that <strong>Dan Geyer</strong> has been named as Vice President of Sales.

The addition of a Vice President of Sales follows an investment in 2023 by PNC Riverarch, a middle-market private equity firm which invests in privately held companies in North America and Europe, in late 2023.

Mr. Geyer is an accomplished, disciplined, and results-oriented sales leader with nearly 20 years of operational leadership, team management, and business development experience. He worked for the US Army for 25 years, holding senior positions focused on recruiting and training. Mr. Geyer then successfully led business development efforts to a large number of industries for commercial printer Sandy Alexander.
