Don’t you wish your marketing could have an immediate impact ON REVENUE at the location level?  That's why we created a magic button that automates digital ads on Google, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube that does exactly that.

Picture this with me: It’s Wednesday afternoon in your Denver location and weekly sales are trending low. No problem, your pre-approved awareness ad on Google just goes live and you didn’t even have to push “go”. 
In fact, you didn’t even need to know sales were off track. Your POS knew and it triggered the ad you created weeks ago inside of the budget you set. Voila...you've got foot traffic. 

… All this while you were getting a coffee.

Not magic enough?

We can automate any ads or programs based off any business data, and give you and your franchisees visibility into where the marketing dollars are spent. And, we even give franchisees tools to manually launch their own ads in minutes, so they can hit their goals without a marketing background.
