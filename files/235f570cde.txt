<a href="https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/featured-supplier/awarity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Awarity</a> is an AI-powered advertising platform that helps brands reach their ideal customers more efficiently than other forms of awareness advertising, driving industry-leading ROI through programmatic advertising.

Programmatic advertising has become a dominant force in digital marketing due to its <strong>efficiency, targeting capabilities, and data-driven approach. </strong>
<h2 style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>Why Programmatic Advertising? </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Programmatic Advertising provides a way for franchise locations to <strong>reach their target audience effectively with localized messaging at the lowest cost possible.</strong> Layering on top of your other marketing, CTV and Banner Ads amplify your other marketing channels by reaching more unique people and driving them to your website.</p>
<p align="justify">With most households already on Connected TV, the opportunities for reaching your target audience on streaming platforms are endless. CTV/OTT will grow a staggering 53.8% this year! <strong>By targeting the end viewer and not the specific channel or time slot, your marketing budget is being used as efficiently as possible.</strong> Franchise networks should not wait to take advantage of this explosive channel.</p>
<p align="justify">Utilizing <strong>HTML5 animated banner ads</strong> allows you to engage with current and potential customers across various channels and apps, ensuring your brand stays top of mind. By appearing on websites your audience visit often or adjacent to specific keywords, <strong>banner ads reach your target audience where they are already spending time online. </strong></p>
<p align="justify">Adding both CTV and Banner ads to your marketing strategy, your brand will have the unprecedented ability to <strong>reach your audience wherever they are for a relatively low cost compared to traditional advertising methods.</strong></p>
