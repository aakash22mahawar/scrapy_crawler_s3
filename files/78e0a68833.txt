Founded Date
1995
We were the first to commercialize the virtual office space, back in 1995. Entrepreneurs with businesses of all sizes were able to leverage flexible office leases to focus and do their best work.

Over 25 years later, the landscape has changed. We’ve reimagined flexible office space to support the modern business owner. While today’s competition may offer office space, we provide productive environments, created to impress clients and provide the professional support to get things done.

Who is the modern business owner? This is a person who is smart, efficient, and driven to succeed in life and business. What they do is often an expression of who they are. At any stage of their company’s lifecycle, they are pulled in a thousand directions, and they want to focus on what they deem most important (and wish the rest could take care of itself).

If this sounds like you, you’ll find a home here.
