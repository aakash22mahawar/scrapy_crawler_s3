The scarcity of affordable, skilled workers has become a bottleneck for franchise growth, crippling the ability to provide support to franchisees and dramatically increasing labor costs. The struggle extends beyond hiring; retention becomes an ordeal, as the demand for talent inflates employee expectations and turnover rates. Senior leadership within franchise brands need a solution that turns the current labor market into a strategic advantage. DOXA® Talent has deep experience helping companies expand their business and build global teams across multiple continents. We’ve harnessed our understanding of both franchising and outsourcing to develop a better offshoring solution for franchisors: Franchise Talent. This provides access to highly-skilled, international talent for franchisors, franchisees, FSOs, franchise aligned businesses that empowers domestic teams and supercharges growth.
