Leading franchise marketing tech company RALLIO just launched an industry changing “smart social media assistant” that does the heavy lifting for franchisees. It guides franchisees on what to do and when…on auto pilot. It suggests captions for local posts, reviews, and even makes hashtag recommendations leveraging the worlds most advanced GTP3 technology (which has read over 40% of the internet).
Responding to reviews and captioning local posts just got A LOT EASIER. It helps franchisees save time & crush writer’s block so that they can easily achieve a much higher review response rate and higher local post frequency.
Instantly get caption options for your reviews (& posts)
Simply select your favorite option, & tap edit or publish!
The smart AI learns your brand and gets smarter over time
It even helps create suggested posts based on past top performing content
