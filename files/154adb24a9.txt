EZee Assist is a platform that amplifies support and strengthens franchise relationships, by using AI to provide around-the-clock support to franchise owners and staff on all operational topics.

With turnkey readiness, the solution allows franchisees to get instant answers to their questions. Integrating seamlessly into franchise systems, it ingests all franchise data - including operating manuals, training videos, and communications. Franchise staff then use the solution as their first line of support – asking questions through their preferred channel (text message, email, MS Teams, Slack, etc.) and getting instant responses. For any questions without ready answers, EZee Assist routes them to support staff.
