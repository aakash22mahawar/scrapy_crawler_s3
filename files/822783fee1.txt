Rallio Case Study: How Premium Service Brands Franchise Boosts Local Presence
Rallio Case Study: How Premium Service Brands Franchise Boosts Local Presence
January 2, 2023
Chuck@rallio.com
Premium Service Brands, a multi-brand franchisor with franchisees in a variety of home services niches, including painting, housecleaning, plumbing, and garage door services, has tapped into a lucrative market of homeowners who would rather pay someone to complete home improvement and services projects than do it themselves. By saving homeowners time and providing expert help in eight different verticals, Premium Services Brands has grown into an industry leader.
Premium Service Brands prides itself on providing franchisees with the training and support they need to carve out a lucrative niche within their industries. Still, Premium Service Brands wanted to provide even more support by way of systemwide social media management and marketing tools. They needed a way to help franchisees build a local presence and streamline the process of creating content, managing reviews and customer engagements on social media, and growing their brands’ presence through social platforms.
To meet their objectives, Premium Service Brands turned to Rallio, which has been able to provide both the social media technology and the localized content and strategy that aligns with the franchisor’s mission and values.
Rallio’s platform benefits the franchise and its franchisees by enabling local owners to connect directly with their communities. With varying tiers of service, the Rallio platform provides these owners with one dashboard where they can create and publish content across platforms. Built-in artificial intelligence technology makes content creation even easier. They are also able to respond to customer reviews, comments, and inquiries quickly, increasing engagement and customer satisfaction.
