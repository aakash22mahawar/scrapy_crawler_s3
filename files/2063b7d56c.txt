ACG's Encompassing Health Program utilizes a Section 125 plan that prioritizes preventative health and includes Group Hospital Fixed Indemnity Insurance. This program does not disrupt or replace any Major Medical Plans, but rather enhances your current benefits for all employees. Encompassing Health is at NO NET COST for employer or employee, and helps to address Recruitment, Retention, and Revenue concerns. By providing baseline health benefits, ACG routinely helps franchise owners increase profitability and decrease turnover by empowering employees to build a career in your franchise system.
