We Help Multi-Unit Franchise Operators Create & Retain Happy, Connected, Loyal Employees. Small Software is an Employee Relationship Management App. Imagine a centralized hub to stay in relationship with your employees and keep them coming back to work. For many franchise owner-operators, their systems to train, retain, and communicate with employees are either duct-taped across multiple logins, or even worse, non-existent. With Small Software you can get off the hiring hamster wheel and keep happy people by keeping people happy. Employees stay longer when they feel connected and respected. We help reduce employee “churnover”* with better human-to-human relationships.
