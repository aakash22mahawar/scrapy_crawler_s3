As the #1 funding supplier choice of top broker networks, FranFund knows what it takes to get a deal done. We have a highly experienced team with extraordinarily low turnover, specializing in SBA loans and ROBS/401(k) rollovers. Known for the best communication among all funding suppliers, we will always keep the candidate, franchisor, and broker well-informed and up to date on how each deal is progressing. We know that each candidate has different circumstances, so we will never push one solution over another – always tailoring it to each individual based on their situation.
Pre-approvals are not a rubber stamp, but FranFund is proud to say that through our proprietary process, candidates enjoy a 99% success rate after receiving a FranFund pre-approval.
