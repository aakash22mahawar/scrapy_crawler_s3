In this Supplier Wire Series episode of Modrn Business Podcast, Zack chats with Petro Loychuk, CEO of Discover My Franchise, a cloud-based sales tool that offers a customizable Discovery Center connected to a powerful Discovery Relationship Manager (DRM), enabling franchisors to streamline their sales process, nurture leads, and drive franchise growth while encompassing a franchise brand's image and vision. Zack and Petro talk about the inner-workings of a "Franchise Discovery Center," how emerging brands are using it to customize their sales process, why a "DRM" is different than a "CRM" and why DMF believes they are the future of franchise sales.
