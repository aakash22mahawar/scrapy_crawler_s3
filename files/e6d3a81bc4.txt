In the franchise world, consistency is king. Service-based franchise brands that leverage QuickBooks for their accounting often grapple with the challenges of maintaining uniformity across operations while ensuring financial health. Enter AR automation through <a href="https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/featured-supplier/biller-genie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biller Genie</a> – a transformative solution that streamlines accounts receivable processes, delivers a seamless back office experience for franchise executives, and reduces payment friction for their customers.
<h4><strong>Reducing Outstanding Accounts Receivable</strong></h4>
For franchise brands, the financial strain of outstanding accounts receivable can be substantial. Biller Genie's AR automation has a proven track record of helping franchises minimize this burden by:
<ul>
 	<li>Accelerating payment cycles with automated invoicing and follow-ups.</li>
 	<li>Enhancing payment flexibility with multiple payment options, leading to faster settlements.</li>
 	<li>Providing real-time visibility into receivables for proactive management.</li>
</ul>
The result? Franchise brands witness a notable decrease in days sales outstanding (DSO), freeing up cash flow for reinvestment and growth.
<h4><strong>Automating Backoffice Workflows</strong></h4>
Labor bottlenecks in the backoffice can lead to inefficiencies and errors in billing processes. Biller Genie automates these workflows by:
<ul>
 	<li>Integrating seamlessly with QuickBooks, ensuring data accuracy and eliminating manual entries.</li>
 	<li>Automating routine tasks like invoice generation, payment reminders, and receipt acknowledgments.</li>
 	<li>Providing a centralized dashboardfor tracking and managing all accounts receivable activities.</li>
</ul>
By automating these tasks, franchise brands can reallocate their human resources to more strategic initiatives, driving greater value across the franchise system.
<h4><strong>Unified Revenue Operations Experience</strong></h4>
Franchise consistency doesn’t just stop at the visual brand experience; it extends to financial interactions. Biller Genie ensures a standardized revenue operations experience by:
<ul>
 	<li>Offering a consistent billing and payment interface to customers, regardless of the franchisee.</li>
 	<li>Enabling franchisees to maintain brand consistency while customizing communications for local market relevance.</li>
 	<li>Providing franchise executives with a holistic view of financial operations across the entire system.</li>
</ul>
This uniform approach solidifies brand integrity and enhances the customer experience from one franchisee to another.
<h4><strong>Proven Savings in Time and Cost</strong></h4>
Perhaps the most compelling argument for Biller Genie’s AR automation is its impact on the bottom line. Service-based franchise brands have reported saving an average of 20 hours per week per full-time employee, translating into significant cost savings. Moreover, the cost of managing these processes through Biller Genie is 80% less expensive than handling them internally. These savings provide franchises with the flexibility to invest in growth and customer service enhancements.

For franchise executives seeking to optimize their service-based brand operations, Biller Genie’s AR automation offers a powerful solution. By reducing outstanding accounts receivable, automating backoffice workflows, and providing a unified revenue operations experience, franchises can achieve operational excellence. The added benefits of time and cost savings underscore the value that Biller Genie brings to the franchise industry. Embrace the future of franchise financial management with AR automation and propel your brand towards new heights of efficiency and profitability.
