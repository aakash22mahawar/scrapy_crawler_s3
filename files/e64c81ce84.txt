The Most Comprehensive Platform for Managing and Operating Home Services Franchises
Upon its founding in 2013, serviceminder.io had one mission in mind: to help home service (and commercial service) franchise businesses acquire and convert more leads, schedule more appointments, close more deals and communicate with clients more effectively.
It began with a world-class CRM built for field service with mapping, automated scheduling and dispatch. Then they added best-in-breed proposal writing with support for options, online deposits and payments, electronic signatures and reporting. Next, they perfected integrated email marketing and automation tools, fleet routing, integrated two-way texting, mapping and campaign budgeting enabling teams to measure revenue from campaigns and track cost per lead and revenue per client at the location and brand level. Oh, and dialed in reporting and analytics so locations and brands can better manage and grow.
The serviceminder.io team knows every brand is different. Whether you are moving from a single platform or from a group where everyone uses sticky notes and Excel, the serviceminder.io team creates a plan to make your on-boarding process as smooth as possible.
