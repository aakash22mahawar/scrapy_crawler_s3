<strong>Irvine California: October 19, 2022</strong>

Leading franchise marketing tech company RALLIO just launched an industry changing "smart social media assistant" that does the heavy lifting for franchisees. It guides franchisees on what to do and when...on auto pilot. It suggests captions for local posts, reviews, and even makes hashtag recommendations leveraging the worlds most advanced GTP3 technology (which has read over 40% of the internet).
<div class="p-rich_text_section">Responding to reviews and captioning local posts just got A LOT EASIER. It helps franchisees save time &amp; crush writer's block so that they can easily achieve a much higher review response rate and higher local post frequency.</div>
