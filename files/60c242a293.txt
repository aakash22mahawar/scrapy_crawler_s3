Just in time for the holidays - how about a little feel good news?

For the last 20 years, Mike Bann from <a href="https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/featured-supplier/bann-business-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bann Business Solutions</a> has helped run a volunteer Christmas tree lot. Over that time he has helped raise $1 million in funds to be donated to the children of a private school in St Paul MN.

In the early years, the lot sold anywhere from 200 - 500 trees a year. This year, Mike and his team will market about 3,000 trees (Balsam, Frazier, Canaan, Douglass, White Pine and more). Over the next 4 weeks, the lot will generate an estimated donation of $100,000 this year.

Have you ever heard the phrase of "doing well while doing good"? With a large display tree, fire pit, decorative lights, hot chocolate, cider, snacks, theme nights and most of Santa's favorite adult beverages, this sounds like one place you can't help but have a festive time.

Thanks for all the good you're doing, Mike! <em><a href="https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/featured-supplier/bann-business-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connect with Bann Business Solutions here.</a></em>
