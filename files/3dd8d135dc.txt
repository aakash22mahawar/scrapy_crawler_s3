We innovate how franchise systems manage e-commerce for both b2b and b2c design (including supplies procurement all the way to customer facing e commerce solutions.
For managing the nuances of purchasing activities for franchise networks:
Imagine
single online store
with everything your franchisees need to purchase, in one unified place
.
Everything from electronics & equipment, to apparel, office supplies, cleaning supplies, toilet paper, scent diffusers. And any “back of house” items that are needed to conduct business.
And of course any retail items that need to be procured.
Benefits:
(1) create new opportunities to
leverage buying power and achieve higher rebate tiers. (2) Eliminate multiple logins, order inaccuracies, and inefficiencies that cost time and money. (3) Your home office AND franchisees spend less time managing procurement and more time on growing the business in a brand compliant way.
For business to consumer e-commerce design:
We have decades worth of success stories and experience in designing, integrating, and delivering on amazing customer experiences.
