As the #1 funding supplier choice of top broker networks, <a href="https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/featured-supplier/franfund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FranFund</a> knows what it takes to get a deal done. They have a highly experienced team with extraordinarily low turnover, specializing in SBA loans and ROBS/401(k) rollovers. Known for the best communication among all funding suppliers, they always keep the candidate, franchisor, and broker well-informed and up to date on how each deal is progressing. They know that each candidate has different circumstances, and will never push one solution over another – always tailoring it to each individual based on their situation.

In this episode of the Franchise Supplier Wire series on Modrn Business Podcast, we sit down with <strong>Shirley Kefgen, Director of Business Development for FranFund</strong>, as she breaks down how to get your candidates funded. FranFund designs flexible, all-in-one funding plans that fit perfectly, no matter how much your franchise or small business grows.
