Founded Date
2020
Founded in 2020 by former athletes, technology professionals and university compliance officials, NOCAP Sports was created to provide trusted, safe and secure solutions for athletes and advertisers entering the new NIL era. What began with simple workflows and automated compliance capabilities quickly evolved to become a more comprehensive platform for these stakeholders – and one focused more holistically on athletes’ NIL journeys within and beyond their collegiate experience.
Today we are a growing team of (even more) former athletes, with an infusion of talent from the advertising, consumer packaged goods, apparel and Web3 industries, among others, and access to thousands of athletes across all levels. With these unique perspectives and our sizable, diverse athlete network, we aim to usher in a new era in athlete marketing – an era in which athletes are equitably rewarded for their contribution to sports and culture, and advertisers are routinely enabled to capitalize on athletes’ influence among fans.
