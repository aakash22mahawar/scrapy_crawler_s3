We know that almost everyone in franchising is gearing up for one of our favorite events of the year - the <a href="https://www.franchise.org/convention">2023 IFA Annual Convention</a>. So, we put together a helpful resource of the top 10 ways to prepare for IFA, whether it's your first time or 20th.

Check out the video, featuring FSN's Ryan Hicks, Zack Fishman &amp; Dean Hatzitheodosiou as well as special guest Paul Rocchio, the VP of Development at IFA!
<h2><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhqFHwNBR98">WATCH HERE</a></strong></h2>
A few takeaways:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Pre-Conference Sales Etiquette: </strong>Vet your list before beginning pre-conference sales outreach. Speaking of outreach, it's all about <em>polite persistence</em>. Spamming franchise leaders, sending mass emails and repeated follow ups is frowned upon, so don't do it.</li>
 	<li><strong>What to Pack:</strong> If you have a booth, send extra scissors, power strips, cable cords, pens, etc. ahead of the conference. We also get into the world of the post-pandemic dress code.</li>
 	<li><strong>Setting Meetings: </strong>Schedule meetings with prospective partners for non-booth hours - a breakfast meeting or during a breakout that they aren't attending. Keep your meetings brief!</li>
 	<li><b>After Hours Events: </b>Don't try to sneak into any events (or beg to get into any that you aren't on the list for).</li>
 	<li><strong>Presenting: </strong>Stay focused and engaged when talking to potential partner - this is different than remote meetings!</li>
 	<li><strong>Booth Etiquette: </strong>Spark conversations and create relationships - this is just as valuable as a focus on sales.</li>
 	<li><strong>Sessions &amp; Round Tables: </strong>Attend presentations that are in adjacent industries and areas of the business, to get a well-rounded education on what's going on in franchising.</li>
 	<li><strong>Networking with Other Suppliers: </strong>Don't be afraid to talk to competitors about common issues or create strategic alliances with other suppliers. There's power in numbers!</li>
</ul>

 	<li><strong>FSN Members: </strong>Email us your top 3 connections you're hoping to make at the Convention. We can help make introductions and even have meetings on your behalf!</li>
