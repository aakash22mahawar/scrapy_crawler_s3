Here’s a few key points our Clients have shared that set us apart: 
•	Custom Solution: We do a customized discovery session with each Client and offer support in every business function including operations, marketing, bookkeeping, sales, HR, admin and executive support. Our signature vetting and assessment process ensures an outstanding fit between Clients and our virtual staff for a long-term, sustainable experience. 
 
•	We Document Your Processes:  From the first day, one of our signature differentiators is the OA Custom Playbook we create for every Client.  Along with pre-set processes and skills our staff bring to Clients, we document every process we execute in your business with written, video and screencast summaries and maintain it daily. It ensures clarity and redundancy. And it is 100% yours from day one as our gift to you as part of working with OA!
 
•	Fully Incorporated: We are fully incorporated in the Philippines so we hire all staff full time with outstanding training and personal development, career path options, a rich culture of recognition and support and benefits for their entire families. This attracts high quality talent and drives retention. Want to see what OA culture is all about? Check out this reel of our Year End party with 500+ staff rocking a year of celebration together. 
 
•	A Culture of Giving Back and Impact: Based on some work our CEO did with the United Nations, we are aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and survey our employees every month about their passions that drive our give-back initiatives. We done tons of projects including planting trees to offset carbon emissions, hunger drives during the pandemic, buying hundreds of new shoes and supplies for children, volunteering at senior citizen and cerebral palsy centers and many other projects OA staff are passionate about engaging.  We were awarded the Real Leaders Impact Award two years in a row for our work.

•	Dedicated Staff: Every staff is dedicated solely to each Client. We do not split staff among Clients to ensure we are “all-in”. Our staff become an integrated part of your team, your mission and core values. 
 
•	Robust Support and Management System:  Along with their OA staff, every Client gets assigned an Account Manager to provide strategic advisory to maximize the OA experience and we have Team Leaders who provide management oversight or the OA Staff along with the Client. We also have over 200+ specialized talent resources for any needs outside your staff’s core skill set. 
 
•	Referrals Speak: The majority of our growth has been driven by Clients sending referrals and adding additional staff once they experience the OA difference due to our commitment to quality.
