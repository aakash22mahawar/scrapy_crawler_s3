Supplier Wire 015: John Francis aka "Johnny Franchise"
As Johnny can tell you… “I am not your average Franchise Advisor, Speaker or Consultant. I have over 30 years of real-world, first-hand experience in franchising businesses, having been a Franchisor, Franchisee and Supplier, with multiple brands. As a franchise expert, coach and consultant, most often I’m asked how are you actually helping your franchise clients? This is what I tell them. I help franchisor executives and franchise owners reduce risks and improve results by providing level-headed expertise. My goal is to help others achieve meaningful success that benefits everyone.”
In this episode of the Franchise Supplier Wire series on Modrn Business Podcast, we sit down with
John Francis or “
Johnny Franchise
,” and dive into John’s more than 30 years of real-world, first-hand experience in franchising businesses, as a Franchisor, Franchisee and Supplier with multiple brands.
