<strong>I</strong><strong>ndianapolis: Nov. 15, 2022 (via <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/woven-raises-1-5m-seed-round-to-streamline-franchise-operations-301678190.html">PR Newswire</a>)</strong>

<u><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3708907-1&amp;h=2677494988&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.startwoven.com%2F&amp;a=Woven" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Woven</a></u>, the leading multi-unit business management software, announced it has raised <span class="xn-money">$1.5M</span> in seed funding led by <u><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3708907-1&amp;h=1758246282&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.glowbrands.com%2F&amp;a=Glow+Brands" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Glow Brands</a></u>. With this funding, Woven will further accelerate its efforts to streamline people management, operations and facility and asset management for franchisees and independent, multi-unit businesses, globally.

To date, Woven bootstrapped 100% growth, with all customer acquisition coming from word-of-mouth referrals and existing customer expansion, resulting in 98% customer retention over the past five years. The funds raised are earmarked almost entirely for sales and marketing program creation for revenue growth acceleration. Additionally, Woven has been implemented at more than 35% of all <u><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3708907-1&amp;h=3686267040&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.planetfitness.com%2F&amp;a=Planet+Fitness" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Planet Fitness</a></u> clubs, 60% of all Buff City Soap locations, other brands such as <u><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3708907-1&amp;h=1724804323&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.petsuppliesplus.com%2F&amp;a=Pet+Supplies+Plus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Pet Supplies Plus</a></u> and <u><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3708907-1&amp;h=2527116476&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.greatclips.com%2F&amp;a=Great+Clips" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Great Clips</a></u>, and across entire brand footprints, like <u><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3708907-1&amp;h=206678925&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.massageheights.com%2Fironworks%2F&amp;a=Massage+Heights" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Massage Heights</a></u> and <u><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3708907-1&amp;h=1234728407&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zipscarwash.com%2F&amp;a=Zips+Car+Wash" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Zips Car Wash</a></u>.

Multi-unit business management has been a widespread challenge within the franchise industry, resulting in low productivity, high employee turnover and disjointed systems.<strong> With Woven's platform, businesses can streamline back office work and manage people, locations and operations from a centralized site, enabling multi-unit operators to increase accountability, productivity and consistency.</strong> The most commonly adopted features include internal communications (e.g., team chat, private chat, company announcements), location audits, and employee shift scheduling and labor management.
