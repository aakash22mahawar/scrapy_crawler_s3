<img class="alignright wp-image-4336" src="https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Richard-Cashdollar-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="232" />

March 4, 2024 (Pittsburgh, PA) – <a href="https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/featured-supplier/clayton-kendall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clayton Kendall</a>, a leader in centralizing the marketing supply chain for franchise communities and multi-location businesses, announced that Richard Cashdollar has been appointed as Chief Financial Officer.

The addition of the CFO role follows an investment by PNC Riverarch, a middle-market private equity firm which invests in privately held companies in North America and Europe, in late 2023.

Mr. Cashdollar, CPA and MBA, has been CFO/Controller for both public and private companies and has public accounting experience in the auditing field with big four accounting firm, KPMG. He most recently worked as Director and Corporate Controller of Harbison Walker, a leading refractory solutions company.

Dan Broudy, CEO, commented, “Clayton Kendall has grown steadily during our 25 year history in serving franchises and multi-location businesses. To accomplish our goal of rapid growth, we are building out our team and investing in outstanding leaders such as Richard Cashdollar.”

“Without question, Clayton Kendall has become the leader in Marketing Supply Chain programs with a demonstrated track record of success across a broad range of verticals,” said Rich Cashdollar. “I’m excited to join Dan and the entire CK team to build upon their momentum to further accelerate market share expansion and drive earnings growth.”
