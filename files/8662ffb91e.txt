With budgets tightening, candidate volumes decreasing, and pressures mounting to maintain or grow franchise sales results today, it's daunting for franchising executives to meet their growth goals.

Despite market turmoil, and without increasing budgets or headcount, the franchise sales team at <em>The Maids</em> franchise was able to <strong>increase franchise sales 300% over the past 14 months simply by replacing their aging franchise CRM technology with ClientTether.</strong>

Read more about their success here: <a href="https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FranDev-Case-Study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClientTether x The Maids FranDev Case Study</a>

Additionally, The Maids' team is now saving hours of lost human capital each month that was spent extracting and analyzing data in their previous system. Now they can easily share their standard dashboard data within ClientTether to report franchise candidate progression/conversion rates through their qualification process to their executive team and board.

ClientTether is the sales automation &amp; CRM platform of choice for franchise systems. Their tools streamline franchise development, &amp; unit-level operations, sales, &amp; growth with leading text, call, &amp; email automation, integrated quoting, payment processing, online reviews, &amp; world-class services to ensure each client succeeds. ClientTether is recognized as a top 2 technology supplier in the franchise industry by Entrepreneur Magazine, and as a categorical leader in client satisfaction and ease of use by G2, Capterra, GetApp, and Software Advice.
