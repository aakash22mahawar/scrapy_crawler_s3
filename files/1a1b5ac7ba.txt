<a href="https://www.goldfishswimschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goldfish Swim School Franchising</a> wanted to use a portion of their Brand Marketing Fund to drive memberships for their franchised swim schools, seeking a campaign that would be both effective and trackable to show beneficial results for each franchisee and a positive ROI on money spent.

Goldfish Swim School used Connected Mail, an omnichannel direct mail and digital campaign solution from <a href="https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/featured-supplier/suttle-straus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suttle-Straus</a>, which included:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Direct Mail</strong> - oversized and personalized postcards sent to purchased lists of 2,500 households within a franchise’s service area based on the demographics of their ideal customer persona</li>
 	<li><strong>Social Match</strong> - ads on Facebook and Instagram which are matched to the mailing list recipients for custom targeting</li>
 	<li><strong>Mail Tracking</strong> – allowing them to see delivery percentage of mail and what day it was delivered</li>
 	<li><strong>Informed Delivery</strong> – a clickable ad in an email from the USPS on the day the mail reaches the consumer’s mailbox</li>
 	<li><strong>Online Follow-Up</strong> - Google display ads retargeting website visitors for 30 days</li>
 	<li><strong>Social Media Follow-Up</strong> - Facebook and Instagram ads retargeting website visitors for 30 days</li>
 	<li><strong>LeadMatch</strong> - collection of anonymous website visitors identified by IP to turn into a leads list for future campaigns</li>
</ul>
The campaign offer was a waived registration fee for new swim students. A 30-day matchback analysis was run at the end of the campaign to identify new members in the Goldfish Swim School Franchising, LLC system that resulted from the mailing campaign.
